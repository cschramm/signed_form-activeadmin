# SignedForm / Active Admin

Integrates [SignedForm](https://github.com/erichmenge/signed_form)
with [Active Admin](http://www.activeadmin.info/).

This eliminates the need to explicitly permit all fields used in
Active Admin forms in the generated Active Admin controllers.

## Usage

    gem 'signed_form-activeadmin'
